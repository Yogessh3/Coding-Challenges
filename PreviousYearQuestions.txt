TCS Digital Previous Year Questions(PrepInsta)

1) Checking if a given year is leap year or not

2) Prime Numbers with a Twist

Write a code to check whether no is prime or not. Condition use function check() to find whether entered no is positive or negative ,if negative then enter the no, And if yes pas no as a parameter to prime() and check whether no is prime or not?

* Whether the number is positive or not, if it is negative then print the message “please enter the positive number”
* It is positive then call the function prime and check whether the take positive number is prime or not.

3) Number Series with a Twist 1

Find the 15th term of the series?   0,0,7,6,14,12,21,18,28

4) Number Series with a Twist 2

Consider the following series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27, 16, 81, 32, 243, 64, 729, 128, 2187 …

This series is a mixture of 2 series – all the odd terms in this series form a geometric series and all the even terms form yet another geometric series. Write a program to find the Nth term in the series.

The value N in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN. The Nth term that is calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT. Other than value of n th term,no other character / string or message should be written to STDOUT. For example , if N=16, the 16th term in the series is 2187, so only value 2187 should be printed to STDOUT.

You can assume that N will not exceed 30.

5) Number Series with a Twist 3

Consider the below series :

0, 0, 2, 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 10, 5, 12, 6, 14, 7, 16, 8

This series is a mixture of 2 series all the odd terms in this series form even numbers in ascending order and every even terms is derived from the previous  term using the formula (x/2)

Write a program to find the nth term in this series.

The value n in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN the nth term that is calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT. Other than the value of the nth term no other characters /strings or message should be written to STDOUT.

For example if n=10,the 10 th term in the series is to be derived from the 9th term in the series. The 9th term is 8 so the 10th term is (8/2)=4. Only the value 4 should be printed to STDOUT.

You can assume that the n will not exceed 20,000.

6) The program will recieve 3 English words inputs from STDIN

These three words will be read one at a time, in three separate line
The first word should be changed like all vowels should be replaced by %
The second word should be changed like all consonants should be replaced by #
The third word should be changed like all char should be converted to upper case
Then concatenate the three words and print them
Other than these concatenated word, no other characters/string should or message should be written to STDOUT

For example if you print how are you then output should be h%wa#eYOU.

You can assume that input of each word will not exceed more than 5 chars

7) Addition of two numbers a Twist

Using a method, pass two variables and find the sum of two numbers.

Test case:

Number 1 – 20

Number 2 – 20.38

Sum = 40.38

There were a total of 4 test cases. Once you compile 3 of them will be shown to you and 1 will be a hidden one. You have to display error message if numbers are not numeric.

8) Consider the below series :

0, 0, 2, 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 10, 5, 12, 6, 14, 7, 16, 8

This series is a mixture of 2 series all the odd terms in this series form even numbers in ascending order and every even terms is derived from the previous  term using the formula (x/2)

Write a program to find the nth term in this series.

The value n in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN the nth term that is calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT. Other than the value of the nth term no other characters /strings or message should be written to STDOUT.

For example if n=10,the 10 th term in the series is to be derived from the 9th term in the series. The 9th term is 8 so the 10th term is (8/2)=4. Only the value 4 should be printed to STDOUT.

You can assume that the n will not exceed 20,000.

9) Sweet Seventeen

Given a maximum of four digits to the base 17(10 -> A, 11-> B,12 -> C, 16 -> G) as input, output its decimal value

Input 1
1A
Expected output
27
Input 2
23 GF
Expected output
10980

10) A Sober Walk

Problem Statement
Our hoary culture had several great persons since time immemorial and king vikramaditya’s nava ratnas (nine gems) belongs to this ilk.They are named in the following shloka:

Among these, Varahamihira was an astrologer of eminence and his book Brihat Jataak is recokened as the ultimate authority in astrology.

He was once talking with Amarasimha,another gem among the nava ratnas and the author of Sanskrit thesaurus, Amarakosha.

Amarasimha wanted to know the final position of a person, who starts from the origin 0 0 and travels per following scheme.

Scheme
He first turns and travels 10 units of distance
His second turn is upward for 20 units
Third turn is to the left for 30 units
Fourth turn is the downward for 40 units
Fifth turn is to the right(again) for 50 units
… And thus he travels, every time increasing the travel distance by 10 units.

Test Cases
Case 1
Input : 3
Expected Output :-20 20
Case 2
Input: 4
Expected Output: -20 -20
Case 3
Input : 5
Expected Output : 30 -20
Case 4
Input : 7
Expected Output : 90 -20

11) Oddly Even

Problem Statement
Given a maximum of 100 digit numbers as input, find the difference between the sum of odd and even position digits.

Case 1
Input: 4567
Expected Output: 2
Explanation : Odd positions are 4 and 6 as they are pos: 1 and pos: 3, both have sum 10. Similarly, 5 and 7 are at even positions pos: 2 and pos: 4 with sum 12. Thus, difference is 12 – 10 = 2

Case 2

Input: 5476
Expected Output: 2
Case 3

Input: 9834698765123
Expected Output: 1

12) Word is Key

Problem Statement
One programming language has the following keywords that cannot be used as identifiers: Break, case, continue, default, defer else, for, func, goto, if, map, range, return, struct, type, var

Write a program to find the given word is a keyword or not


Case 1

Input – defer
Expected Output – defer is a keyword
Case 2

Input – While
Expected Output – while is not a keyword

13) Find the nth term of the series.

1,1,2,3,4,9,8,27,16,81,32,243,….
