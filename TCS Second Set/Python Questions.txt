These methods should be called from the main method.

Instructions to write main section of the code:

a. You would require to write the main section completely, hence please follow the below instructions for the same.

b. You would require to write the main program which is inline to the sample input description section  mentioned below and to read the data in the same sequence.

c. To create BookStore and Book objects , take the inputs in below sequence.

  To create a List of n Book objects read the value of n.

  To create a List of n Book objects read values for pages,price,author,id,title,and create the Book object and add to the List. Repeat this step n times.

Create the BookStore object by passing the List of Book created in previous step.

d. Read the value for the argument to be passed to the method searchBookBypages.

e. Call the method searchBookBypages of the BookStore object created in point  #c. by passing the argument read in point #d.

f. Call the method countBookByauthor of the BookStore object created in point #c.

g. Print the output of both methods as per given sample output.

h. If there is NONE returned from any method print-No Data Found.

Don't use any static text or formatting for printing the result. Just invoke the method and print the result.

Sequence for specific object will follow same attribute sequence as mentioned in the question.You may refer to the sample Input/output for the display format.
